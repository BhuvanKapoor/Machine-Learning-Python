# Machine Learning Models

This repository contains a collection of machine learning models implemented in Python, including both supervised and unsupervised algorithms. The models covered in this repository are:

## Supervised Learning Models

### Classification
- **Random Forest:** A powerful ensemble learning method for classification and regression tasks.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** A discriminative classifier that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate different classes.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** A non-parametric algorithm that classifies data points based on their similarity to nearby data points.
- **Logistic Regression:** A statistical model for binary classification problems.
- **Naive Bayes:** A probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions.
- **Decision Tree:** A tree-like model for making decisions based on a series of simple rules.

### Regression
- **Linear Regression:** A linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables.
- **L1 and L2 Regularization:** Techniques for preventing overfitting in linear models by adding a penalty term to the cost function.

## Unsupervised Learning Models

- **K-Means Clustering:** A popular algorithm for partitioning data into K clusters based on similarity.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for reducing the dimensionality of data while preserving important information.
- **Feature Extraction:** Methods for extracting relevant features from raw data, such as text or images.

## Additional Techniques

- **Encoding Data:** Techniques for encoding categorical data (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding) for use in machine learning models.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Methods for optimizing the hyperparameters of machine learning models, such as grid search or random search.
- **Bagging:** An ensemble learning technique that combines the predictions of multiple models to improve accuracy and robustness.
- **Gradient Descent:** An optimization algorithm for minimizing the cost function in various machine learning models.
- **K-Fold Cross-Validation:** A resampling technique for evaluating the performance of machine learning models.
